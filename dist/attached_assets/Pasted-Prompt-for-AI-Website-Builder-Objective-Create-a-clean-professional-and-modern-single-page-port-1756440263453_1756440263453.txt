3. About Me / My Journey Section:

Heading: "My Journey"

Content:

"In my first semester of college, I began with a phase of self-exploration. That's when I picked up C language and started pushing my first lines of code on GitHub—tiny steps that gave me the thrill of building something real.

By the second semester, I felt drawn to two different worlds. In January, I joined a counseling course, and in March, I dived into machine learning. It was the start of a dual journey—one in understanding people, and the other in understanding data.

The summer of 2024 gave me my first taste of research through an AI/ML internship at DTU. That July, I went deeper into personality development, and in August, I explored modern applied psychology. By October, I was studying deep learning, balancing algorithms with insights into the human mind.

The beginning of 2025 was a turning point. In January, I studied the mathematics of machine learning, and in February, I completed courses on LLMs, GenAI, and LangChain. Around that time, I also spent four months cold-emailing, which finally opened doors to research internships with organizations like BITS Pilani, BARC, IIT Kanpur, UCD, Dartmouth, Princeton, Texas, and Waterloo.

At the same time, my journey in psychology deepened with internships at IIT Kharagpur, Dartmouth, Illinois, and Atmashakti. I also explored darker layers of the mind through a Dark Psychology course, and built resilience and clarity through a Personality Transformation program.

Today, I'm running my own startup—Life Fundies—helping students and young professionals navigate life with more clarity and confidence. Alongside, I continue contributing to open source on GitHub, freelancing on Upwork, and exploring the blend of AI + Psychology that defines my path."
