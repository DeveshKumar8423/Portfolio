                  In my first semester of college, I began with a phase of
                  self-exploration. That's when I picked up C language and started
                  pushing my first lines of code on GitHub—tiny steps that gave me
                  the thrill of building something real.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  By the second semester, I felt drawn to two different worlds. In
                  January, I joined a counseling course, and in March, I dived
                  into machine learning. It was the start of a dual journey—one in
                  understanding people, and the other in understanding data.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  The summer of 2024 gave me my first taste of research through an
                  AI/ML internship at DTU. That July, I went deeper into
                  personality development, and in August, I explored modern
                  applied psychology. By October, I was studying deep learning,
                  balancing algorithms with insights into the human mind.

                  The beginning of 2025 was a turning point. In January, I studied
                  the mathematics of machine learning, and in February, I
                  completed courses on LLMs, GenAI, and LangChain. Around that
                  time, I also spent four months cold-emailing, which finally
                  opened doors to research internships with organizations like
                  BITS Pilani, BARC, IIT Kanpur, UCD, Dartmouth, Princeton, Texas,
                  and Waterloo.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  At the same time, my journey in psychology deepened with
                  internships at IIT Kharagpur, Dartmouth, Illinois, and
                  Atmashakti. I also explored darker layers of the mind through a
                  Dark Psychology course, and built resilience and clarity through
                  a Personality Transformation program.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Today, I'm running my own startup—Life Fundies—helping students
                  and young professionals navigate life with more clarity and
                  confidence. Alongside, I continue contributing to open source on
                  GitHub, freelancing on Upwork, and exploring the blend of AI +
                  Psychology that defines my path.
